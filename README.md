==========

This is a simple project to create a web based quiz where students can answer a variety of math questions and get feed back on how they are doing.

 * To see the Html code open index.html in any text editor

In the class I was using the text editor called Atom, you can download it here : https://atom.io/

this project is using Bootstrap as a base styling library, for anyone interested you can see what's available in the library here: https://getbootstrap.com/
